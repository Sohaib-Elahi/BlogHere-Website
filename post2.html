        <p>KEY POINTS A leading online retailer may have leaked the price and specific 
          release date of the PS5 Earlier, another retailer under the same company posted that 
          the PS5 will have a 2 TB version Sony has not yet revealed the price and release date 
          of the PS5 In 2019, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan announced that the PS5 
          would arrive sometime in the holiday of 2020. Although the Japanese gaming console maker 
          already revealed the full PS5 hardware at a recent event, it did not announce its price. 
          Interestingly, a leading online retailer may have possibly leaked the price and release 
          date of Sony’s much-awaited gaming console. Industry insider Ben Geskin recently shared on 
          his official Twitter account the price of the PS5, which could reportedly go as high as 
          $565 or €499. The tweet also noted that the Digital-only PS5 Edition might retail at $450 
          or around €399. Geskin screen captured the webpage of Amazon France that contains these 
          details. Amazon France also listed the launch date of the PS5 to be on Nov. 20, 2020. While 
          this information is yet to be confirmed by Sony, it aligns with the release window the company 
          earlier announced. Interestingly, the date falls a few days away from Black Friday this year, 
          which is one of the most speculated dates for the arrival of the next generation gaming console. 
          Sony release this picture June 11 of its upcoming PlayStation 5 console, without revealing 
          pricing or a launch date Photo: Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc / - Amazon France removed the 
          listing on its site and the prices of Sony’s PS5 now remain unofficial. It is worth mentioning 
          that this is not the first instance that Amazon listed unannounced details about Sony’s 
          next-generation gaming console. Earlier, Amazon UK listed a 2TB version of the PS5 retailing at 
          $750 or around £599.99. The listing, while not official, and was later removed gave fans the 
          idea of the upcoming console’s price. Additionally, it also disclosed that the PS5 would have a 
          2 TB version. Amazon UK later claimed that the price indicated in the listing is just a place 
          holder. Amazon usually places dummy prices for various products on its site. In other words, 
          these prices could still change. The listing on the Amazon UK went live days before the first 
          PS5 digital event, where Sony officially unveiled the hardware. It is worth mentioning that while 
          these details are interesting, these are not official. It is safe to take this information with 
          a good measure of salt</p>
